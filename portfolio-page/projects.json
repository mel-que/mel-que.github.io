    "context": "The U.S. Gulf Coast has observed rates of mean sea-level rise exceeding 10 mm per year since 2010. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is a satellite-derived measurement that quantifies vegetation greenness (higher EVI values represent more greenness). The EVI trends of the first decade are compared with those of the second decade to identify any regional areas along the Louisiana Coast that may be impacted by sea-level rise.",
    "purpose": "Each of these areas possessed event(s) that likely contributed to the shifts in the EVI trend between the first and second decades of the 21st century. The events are typically categorized as follows: hydrologic restoration efforts in (A), (C), and (D), land fragmentation in (B), wetland class conversion in (E).",

A day is considered freezing if the minimum temperature is less than or equal to 0 degrees Celsius. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is a satellite-derived measurement that quantifies vegetation greenness (higher EVI values represent more greenness). It is anticipated that more freezing days per year would decrease EVI.",
